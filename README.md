Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given the whole code, but I needed to complete the Q-Training Algorithm section. This helped me create a functional code without error.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
We design, develope, and analyze software. This matters because it helps advance humans and solve problems in many fields.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I approach a problem, I will assess the error, identifiy the source or the section of the code with the error, and apply the appropriate algorthim or code block to 
clear the error and have the code function without error.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilites to the user and the organization is security and accuracy. It is my duty to ensure sensitive information is secure and the software is working
without error.
